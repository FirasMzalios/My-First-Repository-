#so this is the most simple print command 

print("\n")#this is like we tapped in Enter 

#-------

print("i'm the danger Tylor")
#or 
print('i"m the danger tylor')
#the difference is between '' and "" but the same result 

#okay pathetic this is too simple 

#-------- 

#multiline print 
print("""woow this sh*t is getting crazy,
       am I tripping or somthn,
       yooo wher am III,
      

      why is the dround moving like this
      
      and that's everyone ois when you fall for the lsd :)""")

#you need to add """ in each side

#but what if we use this 
print("hey guys i'm high right, \n now and decided to learn python \n and i'm teaching you through my repository so you can learn from it when you get high i think... \n anyways")

#and there is this 

print("i'm just wasting too much time in just" + " learning the FUCKING print command in Fucking python " +"\n i'm going to sleep")

#last thing ... do you wanna multiply your phrase ?

print(" eat sh*t sleep repeat" * 365 )
