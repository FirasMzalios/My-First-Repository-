#so before i get sleep let me explain to you how variables works: X is a variable that we can store in it a string, number, integer or even a mathematic formulat...

X= 98

print(X)

A=X/98

print(A)

name="james"

print(name)
print("\n")
#the input function is when you want to ask someone to write something in the terminal
name=input("what is your name ?")
print("\n")
age=input("and how old are you ?")
print("\n")
#what if we want to concatenate your wage with an phrase

print("it's nice to meet you " + name + ", you look so much younger for " + age + " year old! ")

#okay now we all know about input function and how to use variables :)
